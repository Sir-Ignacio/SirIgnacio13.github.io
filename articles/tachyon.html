    <!-- Article -->
    It is a well established fact in the physics community
    that light is the fastest particle in the universe,
    however how would a particle behave if it were faster
    than the speed of light? The tachyon comes from the
    greek word, τάχυον, which means fast when translated.
    The more energy the tachyon loses, then the faster it
    travles. Although it may sound complicated, the math
    coincides with Albert Einstein's General Theory of
    Relativity.
